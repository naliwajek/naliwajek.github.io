title: "Build Your Own Lisp: Intro"
category: Challenges

I decided to formalize my efforts in learning new things by postingwhat I want to do. So here I go.

For the next trick, I'll be doing [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com) which guides you through exactly that â€“ writing your own LISP using the C language.

I will post my thoughts after each chapter, more for a reference than anything else. I'll definietly not spam HN and Reddit with it, douh.
